# evuno — agent instructions

**Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). It is the single source of truth for this repo, for every
agent and every human.** It carries the locked architecture decisions and the
"what NOT to build" list — read those before proposing anything.

## Why this file is a pointer and not a copy

Two hand-maintained copies of the same guide is documentation drift waiting to happen — the
copy is always the one that goes stale, and a steering file asserting something false is worse
than none. This portfolio keeps one master (`CLAUDE.md`) and points everything else at it.
(The convention comes from a real drift incident in a sibling repo; see ask-arthur's
`AGENTS.md` for the post-mortem.)
